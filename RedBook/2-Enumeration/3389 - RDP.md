Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a Microsoft-developed proprietary protocol that enables users to access a graphical interface on a remote computer over a network. It serves as a prominent administration tool, empowering system administrators and managed service providers (MSPs) to remotely control multiple systems as if they were physically present. However, this convenience comes with a drawback, as RDP can become a potential entry point for cyberattacks, emphasizing the importance of secure configurations and precautions.


DisableRestrictedAdmin Must be set to 0 to allow RPD with PTH.

```
reg add HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa /t REG_DWORD /v DisableRestrictedAdmin /d 0x0 /f
```
