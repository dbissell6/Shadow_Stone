## IMAP-POP3

IMAP and POP3 are two protocols used for email management on mail servers. IMAP allows online management of emails directly on the server with folder support, enabling synchronization across multiple clients. On the other hand, POP3 only offers basic email functions like listing, retrieving, and deleting from the server. IMAP's extended capabilities include browsing emails directly on the server and supporting multiple simultaneous users. Clients can create local copies, resulting in a uniform database.

Encrypted versions use ports 993 995
