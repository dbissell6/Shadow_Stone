# SMB
SMB, which stands for Server Message Block, is a network protocol used for file and printer sharing, as well as other communication between computers in a network. It is primarily associated with Microsoft Windows operating systems and is commonly used in local area networks (LANs).

* SMB Enumeration: Penetration testers perform SMB enumeration to identify SMB-enabled systems, shares, and users within the target environment. This helps in mapping the network, understanding the SMB services available, and identifying potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations.

* SMB Version and Protocol Security: Penetration testers assess the SMB versions and the security protocols used, such as SMB1, SMB2, or SMB3. They analyze the encryption options, signing requirements, and security mechanisms in place to ensure the use of secure configurations and identify vulnerabilities associated with specific SMB versions.

* SMB Authentication: Penetration testers analyze the authentication mechanisms used by SMB, such as NTLM (NT LAN Manager) or Kerberos. They evaluate the strength of authentication protocols and look for potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access or credential theft.

* SMB Share Permissions: SMB shares have permissions and access controls associated with them. Penetration testers review the share configurations to ensure proper access restrictions are in place, identify misconfigurations, and assess potential vulnerabilities related to insecure share permissions.

* SMB Relay Attacks: Penetration testers investigate the susceptibility of SMB implementations to relay attacks, such as NTLM relay attacks. They assess whether the SMB protocol is configured securely to prevent such attacks, which can lead to unauthorized access or credential compromise.

## smbclient
-N is a null session, no login cred
-L is to list shares

## EternalBlue

EternalBlue is a cyberattack exploit that takes advantage of a vulnerability in older versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. Specifically, it targets a protocol called Server Message Block (SMB) used for sharing files and printers across networks. The vulnerability allows hackers to remotely execute malicious code and take control of vulnerable machines without the need for any user interaction. The affected versions include Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2008.
