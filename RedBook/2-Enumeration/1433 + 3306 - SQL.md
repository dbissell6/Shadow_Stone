# SQL
SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language, is a standardized programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a set of commands and syntax for creating, querying, modifying, and managing databases.



* SQL Injection: SQL injection is a common attack vector where an attacker manipulates user-supplied data to execute malicious SQL queries. Penetration testers analyze the target application's input validation and parameter binding mechanisms to identify vulnerabilities that could lead to SQL injection attacks. They aim to determine if unauthorized access, data exposure, or other malicious activities are possible through SQL injection.

* Database Enumeration: Penetration testers perform database enumeration to identify databases and database servers within the target environment. This involves identifying the database management system (DBMS) in use, database versions, and available databases or instances. This information aids in further assessment and identification of potential security weaknesses or misconfigurations.

* Database Credential Testing: Penetration testers assess the strength of database credentials and authentication mechanisms. They evaluate the password policies, the use of default or weak credentials, and the presence of any misconfigurations that could lead to unauthorized access.

* Database Configuration Review: Penetration testers review the database configurations for security best practices and potential vulnerabilities. This includes examining user privileges, access controls, database auditing, encryption settings, and network connectivity configurations.

* Privilege Escalation: Penetration testers analyze the database user privileges and assess the potential for privilege escalation. They look for weaknesses in privilege management, misconfigured user roles, or SQL statements that may allow unauthorized users to gain elevated privileges or access sensitive data.
