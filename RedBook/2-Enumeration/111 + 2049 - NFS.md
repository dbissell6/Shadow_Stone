# NFS
NFS, which stands for Network File System, is a distributed file system protocol that allows clients to access and share files over a network. It enables efficient file sharing and collaboration among multiple systems in a networked environment, developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB.

* NFS Exports: NFS servers share directories or file systems called "exports" with clients. Penetration testers identify NFS exports and assess the permissions and access controls in place. They look for misconfigurations or overly permissive settings that could lead to unauthorized access or data exposure.

* NFS Authentication: NFS provides authentication mechanisms to control access to shared resources. Penetration testers analyze the authentication methods implemented and assess their strength. They look for potential vulnerabilities or weak configurations that may allow unauthorized users to gain access to NFS shares.

* NFS Protocol Security: Penetration testers evaluate the security of the NFS protocol itself, including its implementation, encryption options, and potential vulnerabilities. They analyze the version of NFS in use and assess if any known security vulnerabilities or weaknesses exist.

* NFS Access Control: NFS supports access control lists (ACLs) to define granular permissions for individual files and directories. Penetration testers review the ACL configurations to ensure proper access restrictions are in place and to identify any misconfigurations or weaknesses that may lead to unauthorized access.

* NFS Enumeration and Information Leakage: Penetration testers enumerate NFS shares, directories, and file systems to gather information about the target network. They analyze the information obtained to identify potential sensitive data exposure, insecure file permissions, or other security issues.
